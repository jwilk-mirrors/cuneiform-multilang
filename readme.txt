Cuneiform is an multi-language OCR system originally developed

by Jussi Pakkanen. 

This version of Cuneiform has been tested to work on the following
platforms.

Caveats

There are known limitations in this port. Among these are the following:

- it only works on x86 and amd64 processors
- there is no table recognition, because of

Patches to fix any of these issues are gladly accepted.


Compiling on unix

Extract the source and go to the root folder (the one this file is in).
Then type the following commands:

mkdir builddir
cd builddir
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug ..
make
make install 

By default Cuneiform installs to /usr/local. You can specify a different prefix
by giving a command line switch "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/what/ever/you/want"
to CMake.


Compiling on OSX

Follow the instructions for unix above. You can also try the Xcode project
generator. It works but is not maintained.


Compiling with MSVC or MinGW

Run CMake. Point it to the directory you extracted the source to. 
Select a different directory for your build tree, You can not build inside
your source tree.

Select "Visual studio [the version you are using] project files".
For MinGW select "MinGW makefiles." Click "config", then "generate".

In your selected build tree, there are now project files for Visual
Studio, open them by double clicking or via file->open from VS.
Select "Build solution (F7)".

For MinGW go to your build tree and run "mingw32-make". 


Further info on configuration and running

If you have ImageMagick++ on your system, Cuneiform autodetects and builds
against it. Then Cuneiform can process any image that ImageMagick knows how
to open. Otherwise it can only read uncompressed BMP images.

If you want to run Cuneiform without installing it on your system, you
have to point the CF_DATADIR environment variable to a directory
containing the .dat files. These can be found in the "datafiles"
directory of the source package.

WINDOWS NOTE: Cuneiform tries to access its data files in the
directory that contains the DLLs. You can place Cuneiform
anywhere you want on your hard drive, just put the .dat files
in the same directory. This works also when using Cuneiform
as a library.

Running

After install you simply run.

cuneiform [-l language -o result_file -f [outputformat] --dotmatrix --fax] <image_file>

If you do not define an output file with the -o switch, Cuneiform
writes the result to a file "cuneiform-out.[format]". The file extension
depends on your output format.

By default Cuneiform recognizes English text. To change the language use the
command line switch -l followed by your language string. To get a list of
supported languages type "cuneiform -l".

By default Cuneiform outputs plain text. There are several other output formats.
To get a list run the command "cuneiform -f".
